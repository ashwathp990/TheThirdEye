# TheThirdEye

To Judges,

The android application file which I made is too large (1GB with 6678 files) as we use many 
libraries for Image Processing and Natural Language Processing part of the project. Due to this,
we faced issue in commiting and github reported "cannot accept too many files". I reported this
issue to abishek (member of organizing team) and provided all the source code what we coded for 
this complete project. 
Thank you
